    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <p>Cadenza primarily uses two kinds of tags to mark up it's content as a 
    template.</p>

    <p>The first kind is used to inject some kind of text into your output 
    document.  These are called <b>inject tags</b> and always start with
    a double left curly bracket <tt>{{"{{"}}</tt> and end with a double right 
    curly bracket <tt>{{"}}"}}</tt>.  The stuff that comes between the brackets 
    defines what you want to inject into your document.  We will discuss 
    <a href='#inject'>Inject Tags</a> more later.</p>

    <p>The second kind of tag is called a <b>control tag</b>.  These tags are used to 
    control the path Cadenza takes to render your template.</p>

    <aside>We use the word <b>render</b> to talk about the process Cadenza takes
    to write your output document from a template.</aside>

    <p>Control tags always start with a single curly bracket <tt>{</tt> followed 
    by a percent symbol <tt>%</tt>, making it look like this: <tt>{{"{%"}}</tt>.  Like inject tags, control tags end with the
    opposite of what they start with: a percent symbol followed by a right curly
    bracket: <tt>{{"%}"}}</tt>.</p>

    <p>Some control tags come in pairs or even triplets - there's a lot of 
    different kinds!  These control tags form what we call a <b>block</b>, which
    will render differently depending on how the template is set up.  Don't worry,
    we will go into more detail in later sections.</p>

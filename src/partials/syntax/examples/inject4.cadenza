{#
   this very crazy example could be used to center the name in spaces
   with padding equal to the largest name.  Example:

   -------
   Stephen
    Mike 
     Ben
   Michael
   -------

   Most of the time your tags shouldn't have to get this complicated 
   however :)

{{ name | center: (names | map: "length" | sort | reverse | limit: 1) }}
